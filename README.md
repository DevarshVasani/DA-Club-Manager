_Problem Statement_:

You need to build a manager for all the DA-IICT clubs. The manager ensures that a club member can be looked up in minimum time. A member can either be a faculty or a student. One should be able to search by name, ID, specific club name, or club category (i.e., arts, science & technology, sports, culture). Note that the user of this manager may not be a DA-IICT-ian and, therefore, may not know the clubsâ€™ names.

{Due to commit issues in the Old Repo: https://github.com/DevarshVasani/DA-IICT-Club-Manager 
We made a new one}
